In my previous research, I studied the algorithmic inductive biases that allow humans and animals to learn efficiently in challenging environments, and the ways in which they may turn maladaptive in certain psychiatric conditions.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"0f637ded3196e707e4e739a6f9229e9f","permalink":"","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"","section":"authors","summary":"Hi, I’m Sashank!
